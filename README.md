CryptoTax
=========

Do you need to file your taxes on crypto gains? Spoiler alert: It sucks.

This is an attempt to fill those tax forms for you automatically (or at least help you considerably) from exchange-exported trading data.

**NOTE:** This was primarily developed for use to file taxes in Sweden, which might lead to differences in how certain things are calculated or approached.

**Update 2021:** This repo is now deprecated and in maintenance mode. This is due to the emergence of DeFi and the unique challenges it poses for calculating taxes, I've therefore given up on ever being able to calculate my crypto taxes on my own, so I've given up and hired professionals to do the job instead. If you've messed around in DeFi like I have, I recommend you do the same. For Swedes I recommend https://monetax.se, they seem to know their stuff (from my limited experience with them so far).
