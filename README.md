CryptoTax
=========

NOTE: This project now does more than just crypto tax stuff, so the README is outdated.

Do you need to file your taxes on crypto gains? Spoiler alert: It sucks.

This is an attempt to fill those tax forms for you automatically (or at least help you considerably) from exchange-exported trading data.

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress, not ready for use.

**NOTE:** This was primarily developed for use to file taxes in Sweden, which might lead to differences in how certain things are calculated or approached.
